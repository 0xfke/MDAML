## Feature Selection and Model Training

### Selection of Features According to Their Importances

Using a Random Forest Classifier, we evaluated the importance of different features to identify the most significant ones for malware detection. By filtering the features based on their importances, we set a threshold to select only the most relevant features for training our model. This approach enhances the model's efficiency and accuracy.

### Training a New Model Based on Important Features

After selecting the important features, we trained a new model, which yielded the following classification metrics:

| Class    | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Benign   | 1.00      | 0.97   | 0.98     | 1003    |
| Malware  | 0.99      | 1.00   | 0.99     | 2920    |
| **Accuracy**     | **0.99**  |        |          | **3923**    |
| Macro Avg| 0.99      | 0.98   | 0.99     | 3923    |
| Weighted Avg| 0.99   | 0.99   | 0.99     | 3923    |

**Training Scores:**  
The average training score is approximately 99.13%.

**Validation Scores:**  
The average validation score is around 98.63%.

The results demonstrate high performance for both training and validation sets, with only a slight discrepancy of 0.51%.

### Analysis

- **No Overfitting:** The close alignment of training and validation scores indicates that the model is likely not overfitting. In cases of significant overfitting, we would expect a higher training score compared to the validation score.
  
- **Slight Underfitting Possibility:** While the validation score is marginally lower than the training score, indicating a slight potential for underfitting, the difference is minimal.

### Learning Curves

To assess the model's performance over different training set sizes, we generated learning curves. These curves help visualize how the model's accuracy evolves as more training data is added.

### Training and Validation Scores by Training Set Size

The bar chart below displays the average training and validation scores along with their standard deviations across various training set sizes.

By analyzing these scores and visualizations, we gain insight into the model's learning behavior and can make informed decisions for further improvements.
